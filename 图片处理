::LRUCache (Least Recently Used Cache)

::Use a Disk Cache
  memory cache is useful in speeding up access to recently viewed bitmaps, however you cannot rely on images being 
  available in this cache. Components like GridView with larger datasets can easily fill up a memory cache. 
  Your application could be interrupted by another task like a phone call, and while in the background it might be 
  killed and the memory cache destroyed. Once the user resumes, your application has to process each image again.

  A disk cache can be used in these cases to persist processed bitmaps and help decrease loading times where images 
  are no longer available in a memory cache. Of course, fetching images from disk is slower than loading from memory 
  and should be done in a background thread, as disk read times can be unpredictable. ( A ContentProvider might be a 
  more appropriate place to store cached images if they are accessed more frequently, for example in an image gallery 
  application.)
